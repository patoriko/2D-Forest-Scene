## Rendering Optimization
- Similar to code introspection
- The draw window function parameters will include an array or dictionary of layers (dictionary's could allow for a more streamline/implicit ordering system), it would then iterate through the array and draw the layers and update them every frame
- A structure similiar to [[layering]] should be implemented to allow for easy iteration 
- Framerate Independence
- [[world object generation]]
