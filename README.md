The *2D Forest Scene* is a 2D pixel art scene set in a forest designed to have a great sense of atmosphere. 
It is built using an advanced framework built from scratch using nothing but python, pygame and other built in modules. 
This framework/library has many useful features which streamline the game creation process. 

**These features include:**


	- Entity System
	- Animation System
	- Particle System
	- Event System & Custom Rendering Functions
	- Simple Efficient Camera Only 34 Lines (Currently only functions, a camera class is a WIP)
 > Lighting (Coming Soon) <br>
 > Scene Template System -> (WIP) <br>
